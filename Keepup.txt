Property values of a suburb increase if the common areas, 
such as the street and pavements, 
are well maintained and the residents are looking after their properties.
Many believe that it is the responsibility of the local municipality to keep the streets clean.While this belief is not entirely incorrect, homeowners should not negate all responsibility for keeping their suburb in order. It is in the best interest of the homeowner to help keep their suburbs in top shape, says explains Adrian Goslett, Regional Director and CEO of RE/MAX of Southern Africa.

Keepup is a plartform that servers to help people in mainting their suburb conditions. KeepUp helps the suburb by providing 
a plartform where citizens can donate their money and time to clean the streets, pull out weeds, pick-up litter,
resore pavement, replace stolen strom water drain covers and many more ways that can keep the suburb in a good condition. 
When you donate to help your suburb become better and clean, keepup makes sure your donations are put to good use
and the suburb is clean.
